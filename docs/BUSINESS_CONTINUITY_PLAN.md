### Impact Assessment Matrix

| Function | RTO | RPO | Financial Impact/Hour | Operational Impact |
|----------|-----|-----|----------------------|-------------------|
| Customer Communication | 1h | 15m | $10,000+ | Critical |
| Data Processing | 4h | 1h | $5,000 | High |
| User Authentication | 2h | 1h | $2,000 | High |

## Recovery Strategies

### Primary Strategies

#### 1. Automated Failover
- **Description**: Automatic switching to backup systems
- **Trigger**: System health checks fail
- **RTO**: < 30 minutes
- **Responsible**: DevOps Team

#### 2. Database Recovery
- **Description**: Restore from automated backups
- **Trigger**: Database corruption or loss
- **RTO**: < 2 hours
- **Responsible**: Database Administrators

#### 3. Service Migration
- **Description**: Move services to backup infrastructure
- **Trigger**: Infrastructure failure
- **RTO**: < 4 hours
- **Responsible**: Infrastructure Team

### Secondary Strategies

#### 1. Manual Recovery
- **Description**: Manual restoration procedures
- **Trigger**: Automated recovery fails
- **RTO**: < 24 hours
- **Responsible**: IT Operations Team

#### 2. Alternative Communication
- **Description**: Use backup communication channels
- **Trigger**: Primary channels unavailable
- **RTO**: < 1 hour
- **Responsible**: Communications Team

## Recovery Procedures

### Phase 1: Incident Detection and Assessment (0-15 minutes)

1. **Automated Monitoring**
   - System health checks every 5 minutes
   - Alert triggers for critical metrics
   - Automated incident creation

2. **Initial Assessment**
   - Determine incident scope and impact
   - Notify incident response team
   - Activate appropriate response procedures

3. **Communication**
   - Internal team notification
   - Customer communication if service affected
   - Stakeholder updates

### Phase 2: Recovery Execution (15 minutes - RTO)

1. **Isolate Affected Systems**
   - Prevent further damage
   - Redirect traffic if possible
   - Activate backup systems

2. **Execute Recovery**
   - Follow specific recovery procedures
   - Monitor recovery progress
   - Validate system functionality

3. **Data Recovery**
   - Restore from latest backup
   - Validate data integrity
   - Synchronize with primary systems

### Phase 3: Service Restoration (RTO - 24 hours)

1. **System Validation**
   - Comprehensive testing of recovered systems
   - Performance validation
   - Security assessment

2. **Gradual Service Restoration**
   - Phased rollout to users
   - Monitor for issues
   - Adjust capacity as needed

3. **Communication**
   - User notification of service restoration
   - Status updates to stakeholders
   - Post-incident review scheduling
